# AICTE Internship Project - Supply Chain GHG Emissions Predictor

This project estimates **Supply Chain Emission Factors with Margins** based on key supply chain parameters and data quality indicators. It helps policymakers, sustainability managers, and engineers understand and reduce greenhouse gas emissions in supply chains.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Load and preprocess multiple Excel sheets containing emission factors
- Train a **Random Forest Regressor** model to predict emission factors
- Evaluate model performance using Mean Squared Error
- Save trained models and preprocessing scalers for deployment
- Build an interactive **Streamlit web application** for real-time predictions

## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies

- Python
- Pandas
- scikit-learn
- Streamlit
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Joblib
